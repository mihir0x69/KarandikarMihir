## No OSS work
I worked on open source projects back in 2016 and 2017. But after that, regrettably, I haven't been able to contribute back to the community due to work commitments ðŸ¥º

## About me
I'm a passionate software engineer and I work for [udaan.com](https://udaan.com/). I've been around in the industry for nearly 6 years and I've had plenty of opportunities to work on exciting and cool tech! ðŸ˜ƒ
